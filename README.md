sudo docker create volume mongo-plants-volume

sudo docker run -d -p27017:27017 \
--name=mongo-plants \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<PASS> \
-e MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=wild-plants \
--restart always \
-v mongo-plants-volume:/data/db \
mongo:latest
```

to access the shell while running and set up user permissions:
'''
sudo docker exec -it mongo-plants mongosh
db.auth("root")
use wild-plants
db.createUser({user:"radaghast", pwd:<PASS>, roles: [{ role:"readWrite", db:"wild-plants"}]})
```

Push to docker hub
`sudo docker tag wild-plants manfrombritain/wild-plants:latest`
`sudo docker push manfrombritain/wild-plants:latest`

## connectivity - app server to db server
running mongodb container with persistent storage - IP on this host is 172.17.0.2:27017
the app container is running on 172.17.0.3 and they communicate between each other
in future will need to do port forwarding on NAT when they are running on separate machines

⭕ but in app i am using the global root credentials to get permission on mongo in general.  not using radaghast at present
